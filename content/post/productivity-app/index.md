I was driving to the Schaumburg Library to start a coding session when the idea hit me. I had been struggling with my own schedule—trying to juggle programming, reading, and lifting—but I kept running into the same wall: I was overcomplicating my "To-Do" lists. I realized that we often fall into the trap of overestimating what we can do in a single day, yet we massively underestimate what we can achieve in a year. I started wondering if that same logic applied to shorter spans—maybe even just a few hours.

I realized that completion isn't always the best metric. If you set a goal to "Write an App," and you don't finish it that day, you feel like you failed. But if you track the time spent on the craft, you realize that every minute is a deposit into a larger bank of progress. That’s where the idea for my Productivity Timer was born: an app that focuses on the quantity of effort rather than just checking a box.

I spent those first few days at the Schaumburg Library focusing on the core philosophy of the app: gamification and customizability. I wanted to create something that wasn’t just a stopwatch, but a dashboard for your life. By seeing a progress bar fill up for "Programming" or "Reading" right on your homescreen, the act of being productive becomes a game you actually want to win. It’s about quantifying the grind so you can see whether you’re truly meeting your goals or just underperforming.

The roadmap is ambitious. I started on December 26th and hit a working prototype by New Year's Day. Now, as I refine the styling and look toward Android and smartwatch compatibility, I’m focused on that end-goal: a tool that helps me—and hopefully others—stay on track with what we want done most.
