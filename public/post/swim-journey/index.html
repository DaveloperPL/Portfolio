    <p>I joined the swim team my sophomore year under the pressure of my friends who had done the sport for the majority of their lives. The summer prior to the start of the season, I started preparing; I practiced daily at the local gym pool with my friend Victor—who, at the time, was on a nearby rival high school&rsquo;s team. My very first 50-meter swim consisted of four stops mid-pool and took me nearly two minutes. As time passed, I managed to swim the full 50 meters in about 1:10. Soon, learning flip-turns and technique brought me down to the 50-second mark I earned at tryouts. I started my first season on the Frosh-Soph team.</p>
<p>That first season was gruesome and, at times, truly dreadful. The &ldquo;yards&rdquo; were relentless, and the early morning practices felt like a test of my sanity as much as my endurance. My lungs burned every day, and I often felt miles behind the guys who had been swimming since they were kids. But something clicked in the repetition. The dread turned into a rhythm. By the time the final meet rolled around, I stepped onto the blocks and shaved my time down to a 35-second 50-meter freestyle. I was exhausted, but I was hooked.</p>

<p>I returned for my junior year with a new set of challenges. That fall, before the season even started, I sustained an injury that left my shoulder loose and prone to shifting out of its socket. Every stroke felt like a gamble, but I refused to let it sideline me. I moved up to the Junior Varsity team, where the stakes were higher and the training even more intense. Navigating that injury taught me true discipline and the power of consistency; I had to be smarter about my technique to protect my shoulder while still pushing my limits. I finished that season with a 31-second 50-free. More importantly, I laid the foundation for my future athleticism, proving that I could build speed even when my own body was working against me.</p>
